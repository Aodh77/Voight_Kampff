### Description
===============

I code using the program useing diffrent classes and and called the them in the main draw function one of my favorite parts of the programe is the the way text prints to the screen the way the text prints one letter at a time i think really fits with the theme of blade runner I did this by using a for loop to find each chacater of a string and printing them out one by one I also like the animated top bare as it fits with the look of the voight kampff machine from the film I
did the by making 12 small rectangles using a for loop and changed the colour dependening on the the number of the rectangle i then made another black  rectangle the moves back and forth across some of the the rectangles making it lok like it is moving up ad down.
