Holden:
Come in. Sit down.
Leon:
Care if I talk? I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.
Holden:
Uh, just please don't move.
Leon:
Oh, sorry. I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've ever had one of these-
Holden:
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon:
Sure.
Holden:
One-one-eight-seven at Unterwasser.
Leon:
That's the hotel.
Holden:
What?
Leon:
Where I live.
Holden:
Nice place?
Leon:
Yeah, sure I guess-- that part of the test?
Holden:
No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon:
Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden:
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the sudden-
Leon:
Is this the test now?
Holden:
Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down-
Leon:
What one?
Holden:
What?
Leon:
What desert?
Holden:
It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely hypothetical.
Leon:
But how come I'd be there?
Holden:
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling towards you-
Leon:
Tortoise, what's that?
Holden:
Know what a turtle is?
Leon:
Of course.
Holden:
Same thing.
Leon:
I've never seen a turtle -- But I understand what you mean.
Holden:
You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon:
Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write them down for you?
Holden:
The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without your help, but you're not helping.
Leon:
What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden:
I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? -- They're just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response. -- Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good things that come in to your mind about... your mother.
Leon:My mother?
Holden:Yeah.
Leon:Let me tell you about my mother...
